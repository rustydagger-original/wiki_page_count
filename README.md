# wiki_page_count
Simple application to compute the top 25 pages on Wikipedia for each of the Wikipedia sub-domains

1. What additional things would you want to operate this application in a production setting?

      This project requires Python 2.7.16 or higher version to run, and it's been tested  with the following python version and enviroment
      
        Python 2.7.16 (default, Oct 10 2019, 01:00:19)
        [GCC 7.3.1 20180303 (Red Hat 7.3.1-5)] on linux2

    config.yml contains setting specific to this program, user can change accordingly
    
    For example, if running behind a firewall, and get request denied when downloading, user can do the following change
    
        custom_proxy: {"http": [proxy url with port], "https": [proxy url with port]}

2. What might change about your solution if this application needed to run automatically for each hour of the day?
    
    In unix environment, we can create crontab job, and on Windows, we can use window scheduler to run on intervals

    For example, in Unix, to run the program every hour for the day
    
        '0 * * * * /directory/run_wiki_page'

3. How would you test this application?

    Simple test case
    ```
      python manager.py --help # Display usage info
    
      python manager.py 2019-10-17:12 # Run to get data for 2019-10-17 12PM GMT time
    
      python manager.py 2019-10-17:12 2019-10-17:11 2019-10-17:10 # Run on range of day/hours
    ```
